# js-api

#### Project Purpose

- The purpose of this project is to use vanilla JS to retrieve data asynchronously from a web API.
- I used [The One API to Rule Them All](https://the-one-api.dev/) and made a call to the characters endpoint to display over 900 characters from the Trilogy, as well as their spouses (when available)
- No dependencies are needed!
